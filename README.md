OHMySQL can connect to remote or local MySQL database and execute CRUD operations. The framework is built upon MySQL C API, but you don‚Äôt need to dive into low-level. The following diagram represents a general architecture. Logic (saving, editing, removing etc.) is aggregated in the app. The database is just a shared storage.

## Project Support

I wish to support the library and extend API and functionality. If you donate me some money üíµ, it keeps me motivated and happy üôÇ You may support me via [PayPal](

## Installation

Read [documentation](https://oleghnidets.github.io/OHMySQL/documentation/ohmysql/installation) how to install the library as a dependency in your project.

## Usage

Connect to the database.

```swift
let user = MySQLConfiguration(userName: "root", 
                              password: "root", 
                            serverName: "localhost", 
                                dbName: "dbname", 
                                  port: 3306, 
                                socket: "/mysql/mysql.sock")

let coordinator = MySQLStoreCoordinator(user: user!)
coordinator.encoding = .UTF8MB4
coordinator.connect()
```
To end a connection:
```swift
coordinator.disconnect()
```

## Query Context

To execute a query you have to create the context:
```swift
let context = MySQLQueryContext()
context.storeCoordinator = coordinator
```

### Execute Query

```swift
let dropQueryString = "DROP TABLE `MyTable`"
let dropQueryRequest = MySQLQueryRequest(queryString: dropQueryString)
try? context.execute(dropQueryRequest)
```

### SELECT 

The response contains the array of the dictionaries.

```swift
let query = MySQLQueryRequestFactory.select("tasks", condition: nil)
let response = try? context.executeQueryRequestAndFetchResult(query)
```

### INSERT

```swift
let query = MySQLQueryRequestFactory.insert("tasks", set: ["name": "Something", "desctiption": "new task"])
try? context.execute(query)
```

### UPDATE

```swift
let query = MySQLQueryRequestFactory.update("tasks", set: ["name": "Something"], condition: "id=7")
try? context.execute(query)
```

### DELETE

```swift
let query = MySQLQueryRequestFactory.delete("tasks", condition: "id=10")
try? context.execute(query)
```

### JOINs

You can execute 4 types of joins - `INNER`, `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `FULL`.

```swift
let query = MySQLQueryRequestFactory.joinType(OHJoinInner, fromTable: "tasks", columnNames: ["id", "name", "description"], joinOn: ["subtasks": "tasks.id=subtasks.parentId"])
let result = try? context.executeQueryRequestAndFetchResult(query)
```

### Object Mapping

You have to implement the protocol `OHMappingProtocol` for your models. 
The library has only a primary logic for mapping, so I would recommend you writing a mapping logic by yourself. If you are using Swift you cannot use fundamental number types (`Int`, `Double`), only `NSNumber` (due to run-time). 

```swift
context.insertObject(task)
try? context.save()
```

You can update/delete the objects easily.

```swift
let task = Task()
task.name = "sample"
context.updateObject(task)
context.deleteObject(task)

try? context.save()
```
